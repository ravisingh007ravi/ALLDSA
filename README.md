# Frequency Counter
What is the “Frequency Counter” pattern? The Frequency Counter pattern uses an object or set to collect values and the frequency of those values. This pattern is often used with an array or a string , and allows you to avoid nested loops (quadratic time complexity O(n²) ).

# Multiple Pointer
Creating Pointers or Values that Correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning,
end or middle based on a certain condition Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space
complexity as well.

# Sliding  Window
The Sliding window is a problem-solving technique of data structure and algorithm for problems that apply arrays or lists. These problems are painless to solve using a brute force approach in O(n²) or O(n³). However, the Sliding window technique can reduce the time complexity to O(n).

# Recursion
Recursion in data structure is when a function calls itself indirectly or directly, and the function calling itself is known as a recursive function.


# Sorting 
In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.

# Types of Sorting

1)Insertion Sort
2)Selection Sort
3)Binary Search
4)Quick Sort  
5)Merge Sort
